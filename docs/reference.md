read_inbox({ team_name: "my-team", agent_name: "security-bot" })

// Wait for new messages (efficient, no polling)
read_inbox({ team_name: "my-team", wait_for_new: true })

// Wait with custom timeout (5 minutes)
read_inbox({ team_name: "my-team", wait_for_new: true, timeout_seconds: 300 })

## Task Planning & Approval

### task_submit_plan

For teammates to submit their implementation plans for approval.

**Parameters**:
- `team_name` (required): Name of the team
- `task_id` (required): ID of the task
- `plan` (required): Implementation plan description

**Behavior**:
- Updates task status to `planning`
- Saves the plan to the task
- Lead agent can then review and approve/reject

**Example**:
```javascript
task_submit_plan({
  team_name: "my-team",
  task_id: "task_abc123",
  plan: "1. Add password strength validator component\n2. Integrate with existing signup form\n3. Add unit tests using zxcvbn library"
})
```

---

### task_evaluate_plan

For the lead agent to approve or reject a submitted plan.

**Parameters**:
- `team_name` (required): Name of the team
- `task_id` (required): ID of the task
- `action` (required): `"approve"` or `"reject"`
- `feedback` (optional): Feedback message (required when rejecting)

**Behavior**:
- **Approve**: Sets task status to `in_progress`, clears any previous feedback
- **Reject**: Sets task status back to `in_progress` (for revision), saves feedback

**Examples**:
```javascript
// Approve plan
task_evaluate_plan({
  team_name: "my-team",
  task_id: "task_abc123",
  action: "approve"
})

// Reject with feedback
task_evaluate_plan({
  team_name: "my-team",
  task_id: "task_abc123",
  action: "reject",
  feedback: "Please add more detail about error handling and edge cases"
})
```

---

## Automated Behavior

### Initial Greeting

When a teammate is spawned, they automatically:
1. Send a message to the lead announcing they've started
2. Begin checking their inbox for work

**Example message**: "I've started and am checking my inbox for tasks."

---

### Idle Polling

If a teammate is idle (has no active work), they automatically check for new messages every **30 seconds**.

This ensures teammates stay responsive to new tasks, messages, and task reassignments without manual intervention.

---

### Automated Hooks

When a task's status changes to `completed`, pi-teams automatically executes:

`.pi/team-hooks/task_completed.sh`

The hook receives the task data as a JSON string as the first argument.

**Common hook uses**:
- Run test suite
- Run linting
- Notify external systems (Slack, email)
- Trigger deployments
- Generate reports

**See [Usage Guide](guide.md#hook-system) for detailed examples.**

---

### Context Injection

Each teammate is given a custom system prompt that includes:
- Their role and instructions
- Team context (team name, member list)
- Available tools
- Team environment guidelines

This ensures teammates understand their responsibilities and can work autonomously.

---

## Task Statuses

### pending

Task is created but not yet assigned or started.

### planning

Task is being planned. Teammate has submitted a plan and is awaiting lead approval. (Only available when `plan_mode_required` is true for the teammate)

### in_progress

Task is actively being worked on by the assigned teammate.

### completed

Task is finished. Status change triggers the `task_completed.sh` hook.

### deleted

Task is removed from the active task list. Still preserved in data history.

---

## Configuration & Data

### Data Storage

All pi-teams data is stored in your home directory under `~/.pi/`:

```
~/.pi/
├── teams/
│   └── <team-name>/
│       └── config.json      # Team configuration and member list
├── tasks/
│   └── <team-name>/
│       ├── task_*.json      # Individual task files
│       └── tasks.json       # Task index
└── messages/
    └── <team-name>/
        ├── <agent-name>.json  # Per-agent message history
        └── index.json         # Message index
```

### Team Configuration (config.json)

```json
{
  "name": "my-team",
  "description": "Code review team",
  "defaultModel": "gpt-4o",
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "security-bot",
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "thinking": "medium",
      "planModeRequired": true
    },
    {
      "name": "frontend-dev",
      "model": "haiku",
      "thinking": "low",
      "planModeRequired": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Task File (task_*.json)

```json
{
  "id": "task_abc123",
  "subject": "Audit auth endpoints",
  "description": "Review all authentication endpoints for vulnerabilities",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "owner": "security-bot",
  "plan": "1. Scan /api/login\n2. Scan /api/register\n3. Scan /api/refresh",
  "planFeedback": null,
  "blocks": [],
  "blockedBy": [],
  "activeForm": "Auditing auth endpoints",
  "createdAt": "2024-02-22T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-02-22T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Message File (<agent-name>.json)

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "msg_def456",
      "from": "team-lead",
      "to": "security-bot",
      "content": "Please focus on the auth module first",
      "summary": "Focus on auth module",
      "timestamp": "2024-02-22T10:15:00Z",
      "read": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Environment Variables

pi-teams respects the following environment variables:

- `ZELLIJ`: Automatically detected when running inside Zellij. Enables Zellij pane management.
- `TMUX`: Automatically detected when running inside tmux. Enables tmux pane management.
- `PI_DEFAULT_THINKING_LEVEL`: Default thinking level for spawned teammates if not specified (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`).

---

## Terminal Integration

### tmux Detection

If the `TMUX` environment variable is set, pi-teams uses `tmux split-window` to create panes.

**Layout**: Large lead pane on the left, teammates stacked on the right.

### Zellij Detection

If the `ZELLIJ` environment variable is set, pi-teams uses `zellij run` to create panes.

**Layout**: Same as tmux - large lead pane on left, teammates on right.

### iTerm2 Detection

If neither tmux nor Zellij is detected, and you're on macOS with iTerm2, pi-teams uses AppleScript to split the window.

**Layout**: Same as tmux/Zellij - large lead pane on left, teammates on right.

**Requirements**:
- macOS
- iTerm2 terminal
- Not inside tmux or Zellij

---

## Error Handling

### Lock Files

pi-teams uses lock files to prevent concurrent modifications:

```
~/.pi/teams/<team-name>/.lock
~/.pi/tasks/<team-name>/.lock
~/.pi/messages/<team-name>/.lock
```

If a lock file is stale (process no longer running), it's automatically removed after 60 seconds.

### Race Conditions

The locking system prevents race conditions when multiple teammates try to update tasks or send messages simultaneously.

### Recovery

If a lock file persists beyond 60 seconds, it's automatically cleaned up. For manual recovery:

```bash
# Remove stale lock
rm ~/.pi/teams/my-team/.lock
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Idle Polling Overhead

Teammates poll their inboxes every 30 seconds when idle. This is minimal overhead (one file read per poll).

### Lock Timeout

Lock files timeout after 60 seconds. Adjust if you have very slow operations.

### Message Storage

Messages are stored as JSON. For teams with extensive message history, consider periodic cleanup:

```bash
# Archive old messages
mv ~/.pi/messages/my-team/ ~/.pi/messages-archive/my-team-2024-02-22/
```
